# File_Convertor
Connecting to an API to convert files.
I used Tkinter to build the GUI and the API convertapi, to convert the files. In order to use this code you need to crate an account in the following https://www.convertapi.com/,
after that you will have a key under the tab "API Secret", you must insert your key in the code under the function def file_convert():, in the first line convertapi.api_secret = "INSERT YOUR KEY HERE"
